# FEWDproject
class project


This is a small website designed to give the visitor some basic information about learning to ride a motorcycle.  Rather than have the visitor be overwhelmed by all of the content at once, the information is broken up into subjects.  

With this project, I decided to try having all of the content load in a single HTML file, but to hide all content not selected with JavaScript.
